							<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
							I started my academic journey at College Bois de Boulogne in Montreal, where I pursued a degree in 
							Software Quality Assurance, delving into the fundamentals of software engineering and programming. 
							My education primarily focused on Quality Assurance (QA), and I gained extensive knowledge in utilizing 
							tools such as Jira, Confluence, and Redmine to manage and streamline software development processes. 
							<br>Additionally, coursework included automation, where I honed my skills using tools like Visual Studio Code, 
							PyCharm, and Eclipse to enhance efficiency and precision in software development. Since completing my formal 
							education, I've remained dedicated to continuous learning, actively engaging with open source projects to 
							further expand my knowledge and skills. 
							<br>Currently, I'm undertaking a short program in data science, with plans to pursue a major in the field 
							and attain a bachelor's degree to deepen my expertise

<br>
								<p style="margin-left: 40px">
								A few months before graduation, I secured a position at Lionbridge Canada as a Test Associate. 
								Demonstrating my dedication and skills, I quickly earned a promotion to Senior Test Expert 
								within just a few months. While I have found fulfillment in Quality Assurance (QA), my growing 
								interest in data science has become a compelling focus. Recognizing the potential of data science 
								to unlock new insights, I am currently exploring opportunities to transition my career into this 
								dynamic field.
