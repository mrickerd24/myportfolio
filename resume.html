<br>
							<p style="margin-left: 40px;">
							I started my academic journey at College Bois de Boulogne in Montreal, where I pursued a degree in 
							Software Quality Assurance, delving into the fundamentals of software engineering and programming. 
							My education primarily focused on Quality Assurance (QA), and I gained extensive knowledge in utilizing 
							tools such as Jira, Confluence, and Redmine to manage and streamline software development processes. 
							<br>Additionally, coursework included automation, where I honed my skills using tools like Visual Studio Code, 
							PyCharm, and Eclipse to enhance efficiency and precision in software development. Since completing my formal 
							education, I've remained dedicated to continuous learning, actively engaging with open source projects to 
							further expand my knowledge and skills. 
							<br>Currently, I'm undertaking a short program in data science, with plans to pursue a major in the field 
							and attain a bachelor's degree to deepen my expertise
							<br>
							<br>
							I graduated from<a href="https://www.bdeb.qc.ca/" class="college-button">College Bois de Boulogne</a> as a Software Quality Assurance Specialist in April 2023.

								<p style="margin-left: 40px">
								A few months before graduation, I secured a position at Lionbridge Canada as a Test Associate. 
								Demonstrating my dedication and skills, I quickly earned a promotion to Senior Test Expert 
								within just a few months. While I have found fulfillment in Quality Assurance (QA), my growing 
								interest in data science has become a compelling focus. Recognizing the potential of data science 
								to unlock new insights, I am currently exploring opportunities to transition my career into this 
								dynamic field.
								<br>
								In my professional journey, I've developed into a focused and dedicated worker, consistently striving 
								for excellence in my tasks. My current role has honed not only my technical skills but also my soft skills, 
								emphasizing effective communication and collaboration. While I tend to thrive as an independent worker, 
								I recognize the importance of teamwork and am adaptable when required. I've cultivated a reputation for being a 
								quick learner, taking the initiative to teach myself various skills that contribute to my professional growth. 
								While I may lean towards a more reserved working style, I am committed to fostering positive interactions in a team 
								environment, even when faced with challenges. My ability to navigate and overcome obstacles, coupled with a strong 
								self-learning ethic, reflects my commitment to continuous improvement and achieving success in any endeavor.
								<br>
								<br>
								I was hired as a Test Associate at<a href="https://www.lionbridge.com/" class="college-button">Lionbridge Canada</a> on Janurary 9th 2023.
								<br>
								I was promoted to Senior Test Expert August 1st 2023.
