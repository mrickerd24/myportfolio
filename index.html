								Hello, I am a Senior Test Expert at Lionbridge Canada, where I lead a team of 10 test associates. In this role, I leverage my expertise to ensure the quality and reliability of video game products, contributing to the success of various gaming projects within the company.
								<br><br>
								Passionate about staying current in the ever-evolving tech landscape, I continuously expand my skill set. I am proficient in HTML, Python, JavaScript, Robot Framework, Selenium, and various other programming languages and tools. This dedication to learning enables me to adapt to the latest advancements in the field.
								<br><br>
								Currently, I am exploring the exciting field of data science, aiming to shift my focus towards data analysis and machine learning. I have begun my journey into these domains, gaining proficiency in tools like Jupyter and Tableau. This shift represents my commitment to exploring new challenges and pushing the boundaries of my knowledge.
								<br><br>
								Beyond my professional pursuits, I am also a competitive figure skater. This passion for figure skating reflects my discipline, dedication, and drive for excellence, both on and off the ice. These qualities are integral to my approach in all aspects of life and work.
